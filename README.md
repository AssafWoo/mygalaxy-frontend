## Star Wars Data Viewer: React App Guide
Welcome to the Star Wars Data Viewer! This React application is designed to present various data related to the Star Wars universe in an interactive and user-friendly way. It utilizes REM units for consistent scaling and responsive design, with the base unit set as 1rem = 16px.

This project was initialized using Create React App, a robust setup for building React applications.

Scripts for Project Management
Within the project directory, you have several scripts available:

## npm start
This command starts the development server. Access the app in development mode at http://localhost:3001. The app will reload if you make edits, and you'll see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test
Initiate the test runner in interactive watch mode. More details can be found in the testing documentation.

## npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance by minifying and hashing filenames. The app will be ready for deployment post this process. See deployment guidelines for more info.

## npm run eject
Caution: irreversible action! This command removes the single build dependency and copies configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project. This is ideal for custom configurations but can't be reversed. All commands except eject will still function, but they will point to the copied scripts. You are in full control after ejecting.
